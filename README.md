# JokeBot
An interactive bot made with Rasa that tells the user jokes. The bot is a friend trying to become a comedian and the user's role is to give feedback on their jokes. 

## How to Run
 To run the bot, make sure you have `rasa x` installed on `Anaconda` or any python virtual environment. For detailed instructions on the installation of Rasa please refer to the official documentation: [How to Install Rasa X](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/install/local-mode).

Usually all you need to do is run the following command:
```pip3 install rasa-x --extra-index-url https://pypi.rasa.com/simple```

If the above doesn't work, refer to the documentation linked above.


Once Rasa X has been installed, navigate to the root folder of the project, and do the following:
 - run `rasa x` and wait for it to launch. **Note:** This may take a while depending on your system.
 - _**VERY IMPORTANT**_ : In a **separate** terminal window/tab, run the command `rasa run actions`, to run a custom actions server for the bot to be able to work properly.

Once the commands finish running, they should open up a browser window that goes directly to Rasa X like so:

If you hover over the toolbar to the left, and click the option that says "Talk to you assistant", you can speak to the bot in a GUI.

On this screen, simply type a message like "hey", to get started!

Have fun talking to our bot!

## Updates
 The bot now has a GUI, it also generates photo based memes, and responds to invalid user inputs.
