      Some members of a health club were having their first meeting.
      The director of the group said, "Now, I'd like each of you to give the facts of your daily routine."

      Several people spoke, admitting their excesses, and then one obviously overweight member said,
      "I eat moderately, I drink moderately, and I exercise frequently."

      "Hmm?" said the manager.

      "And are you sure there is nothing you over-indulge in?"

      "Well," said the man,"I lie extensively."

      A very homely person made an appointment with a psychiatrist.

      The homely person walked into the doctor's office and said, "Doctor, I'm so depressed and lonely. I don't have any friends,
      no one will come near me, and everybody laughs at me. Can you help me accept my ugliness?"

      "I'm sure I can." the psychiatrist replied. "Just go over and lie face down on that couch."

      All ya have is your old John Deere tractor and combine."

      Ole replied,"Yup, and they're boat for sale."

      A screenwriter came home to a burned down house. His sobbing and slightly singed wife was standing outside.

      "What happened, honey?" the man asked."Oh, John, it was terrible," she wept.

      "I was cooking when the phone rang. It was your agent. Because I was on the phone, I didn't notice the stove had caught on fire.

       It went up in seconds. Everything is gone. All our family pictures were destroyed. Yearbooks, trophies... I nearly didn't make it out of the house.

        I have no idea where the dog is..." "Whoa there, back up a minute!" the man said. "My agent called?"

      Sad News! It's always difficult to bring sad news but I think everyone should know that there was a great loss in the entertainment world.

      The man that wrote the "Hokey Pokey" died. What's really horrible was they had trouble keeping the body in the casket.

      They'd put his left foot in......well, you know the rest...

      This guy walks into a bar down in Alabama and orderes a mudslide.

      The bartender looks at the man and says "You're not from round here are ya?"

      "No" replied the man, "I'm from Pensylvania."

      The bartender looks at him and says "Well what do you do in Pensylvania?"

      "I'm a taxidermist." said the man.

      The bartender, looking very bewildered, now asked "What in the world is a tax-e-derm-ist?"

      The man looked at the bar tender and said "Well, I mount dead animals."

      The bartender stands back and hollers to the whole bar which is staring at him "It's okay, boys! He's one of us!"

      A young man from the city went to visit his farmer uncle.
      For the first few days, the uncle showed him the usual things chickens, cows, crops, etc.

      After three days, however, it was obvious that the nephew was getting bored, and the uncle was running out of things to amuse him with.
      Finally, the uncle had an idea. "Why don't you grab a gun, take the dogs, and go shooting?"

      This seemed to cheer the nephew up, and with enthusiasm, off he went, dogs in trail.

      After a few hours, the nephew returned. "How did you enjoy that?" asked the uncle.

      "It was great!" exclaimed the nephew. "Got any more dogs?"

      A woman gets on a bus holding her baby. "That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen," says the bus driver.

      In a huff, the woman slams her fare into the box and takes an aisle seat near the rear of the bus.

      The man seated next to her senses her agitation and asks what's wrong. "The bus driver insulted me!" she shouts.

      The man replies, "Well, he's a public servant and shouldn't say things to insult passengers!"

      "You're right," says the woman.

      "I think I'll go back up there and give him a piece of my mind!"

      "That's a good idea," the man replies. "Here, let me hold your monkey."

      Steve falls off and is killed instantly.

      2 hours later, he comes back carrying a 6-pack.

      Charlie says, "Where did you get that, Bill?"

      "Steve's wife gave it to me."

      "That`s unbelievable, you told the lady her husband was dead and she gave you the beer?"

      "Just to establish some parameters," said the professor to the student from Arkansas, "What is the opposite of joy?"

      "Sadness," said the student.

      "And the opposite of depression?" he asked of the young lady from Oklahoma.

      "Elation," said she."And you sir," he said to the young man from Texas, "how about the opposite of woe?"

      The Texan replied, "Sir, I believe that would be giddy-up."

      Once there were two twins, Joe and John. Joe was the owner of a dilapidated old boat.

      It so happened that John's wife died the same day that Joe's boat sank.

      A few days later, a kindly old woman saw Joe a mistook him for John.

      She said, "I'm sorry to hear about your loss. You must just feel terrible.

      Joe thinking that she was talking about his boat, said, "Hell no in fact is I'm sort of glad to be rid of her.

      She was a rotten old thing right from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old dead fish.

      She was always losing her water, she had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too.

      Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy.

      I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to these four guys looking for a good time.

      I warned them that she wasn't very good, but they wanted to use her anyhow.

      The fools tried to get in her all at once and she split right up the middle." The old lady fainted.
